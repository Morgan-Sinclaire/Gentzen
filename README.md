# Gentzen
Coq implementation of Gentzen's consistency proof of Peano Arithmetic (PA), using Primitive Recursive Arithmetic and the well-foundedness of all ordinals below Epsilon_0. The version of the proof we are implementing is exposited in Mendelson's textbook. As of early March 2019, this is still a few thousand lines short of completion, but we believe the hardest problems have been solved, and the completed code with a detailed write-up should be up in about 2 months.
